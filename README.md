* [netlify-functions-ecommerce](netlify-functions-ecommerce)
* [discord-bot](discord-bot)

## Prerequisites

In order to run these demos, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 14 or higher installed. 

You'll also need to run a copy of the Stargate infrastructure stack including the JSON API. 
The simplest way to do this is by using the script found under the [bin](bin) directory 
to start the stack with [Docker](https://docker.com):

```
cd stargate-mongoose-sample-apps 
bin/start_json_api.sh
```
